It's all about particles.

Particles.js is a small particle system written in javascript highly inspired by Cocos2d's particle system and @71squared's Particle Designer.

Particles.js was developed and tested in the latest version of Google Chrome.
The aim of this project is to have a tiny javascript library which gives you the possibility to embed a particle system to your website.

This project is an experiment and should not be used in your commercial projects.

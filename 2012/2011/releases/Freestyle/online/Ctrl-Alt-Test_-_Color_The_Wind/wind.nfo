  Hi, DemoJS!

   This is my  little contribution to this great  party, sent directly
   from Budapest. It is a simple  2D Canvas demo. No sound, no WebGL —
   KISS :)

   It is coded using WebSharper,  an F# web development framework. The
   JavaScript is generated, so please don't bother looking at it, it's
   quite ugly :) I included the F# source, for those curious enough.

   At the beginning, you can choose the number of particles displayed.
   I used 1000  particles when developing on a Core  2 E8500 / HD4870,
   but don't hesitate to augment this number if your setup is better !

   My greetings  go to all the  folks at demoscene.fr,  and my friends
   from Prologin — thanks guys for your role in organizing this event!

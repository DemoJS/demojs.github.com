    <p>DJ-PIE combines his love for gaming and electronic music to create powerful dancefloor beats making the most of the Nintendo Game Boy, despite the very tight hardware constraints.   
    <br />From electro to happy hardcore, including tropical, dubstep and industrial vibes, he already seduced the crowd many times (lately in the Toy Festival in Montréal, QC, Canada).

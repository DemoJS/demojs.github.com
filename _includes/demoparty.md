## The web demoparty, with a twist

**DemoJS** is the last demoparty dedicated to the web arcanes. It has started as part of the
mozilla initiative to bring attention of the demo community to the web. After
4 sessions, the demoparty is back and is now a special place for the demoscene in Paris.

That said, this year is special. We've decided to open competitions to **all platforms**, not only
web. So if you feel like saying **FUCK JS** and are more into oldskool, PC, toasters, or in fact
whatever you can make a demo with, this is for you. Come at DemoJS, and [**FUCK JS**](http://tmp.graphics/releases/fuckjs/).

## Good vibes

DemoJS is before anything else a demoparty open to everyone:

 * The event is free
 * There is something for everyone (concerts, conferences, beers...)
 * The team is friendly and eager to help newcomers

## What to bring to a demoparty?

 * Your computer
 * An ethernet cable
 * Your creativity!

## The last web demoparty

**DemoJS** is the last demoparty dedicated to the web arcanes. It has started as part of the
mozilla initiative to bring attention of the demo community to the web. After
4 sessions, the demoparty remains and is now a special place for the demoscene in Paris.

This year, the competition also accepts entries from all platforms: *fuckJS*! If you
like oldskool, PC, toasters or anything else, make the show!

## Good vibes

DemoJS is before everything else a demoparty open to everyone :

 * the event is free
 * there is content for everyone (concerts, conferences, beers...)
 * the team is friendly and eager to help newcomers

## What to bring to a demoparty?

 * your computer
 * an ethernet cable
 * your creativity!

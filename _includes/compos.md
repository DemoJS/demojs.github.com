## Compos
### Browser 1k
Play with a few bytes !

 * Everything needs to fit in one or more files. 
 * Total size must not exceed 1k, including HTML, JavaScript and all resources required to run the intro.
 * Note that 1k means 1024 bytes or less. We’re not counting in characters, but in bytes (beware of unicode).
 * The production have to work offline. 
 * You are NOT allowed to retrieve content from the Internet
 * You should not use any operating system provided media files such as the "Media" and "Music Samples" directory
 * You can use built-in generic fonts such as serif, sans-serif.
 * No shim is provided.
 * Total size must not exceed size limit.

### Browser 8k
Try to put cool visuals and music in 8k !

 * Same rules as in 1k category except the size allowed here 8k wich is 8192 bytes.

### Browser demo
THE compo

 * No maximum filesize. However don’t try to run a movie in an iframe.
 * Must be a non-interactive.
 * You can retrieve external content from the Internet, but it is at **your own risk**. We shall not be liable for connection problems during demo projection.

### Fast prodz
These compos will be focused on specific aspects of demos, such as 3D modeling or specific platforms, with a specific theme revealed the day of the demoparty. More on those will be announced soon.


### Special prizes

A DemoJS’s panel will give special awards to compos chosen based on the following criteria :

 * **The most browser-compatible demo**&nbsp;: The whole world does not use last version of Chrome, and compatibility between browsers remains a key issue of web development. Also we prefer well-coded generic demos that behave equal in all browsers, than demos which works nice because of browser specific hacks.
 * **The most original demo**&nbsp;: Unusual browser technologies and original concepts will be appreciated.

### 3D gfx fast compo
This is a special compo in partnership with [SketchFab](http://sketchfab.com)
Sketchfab is a web service to publish and embed interactive 3D models on any web page, and display them in real-time without a plugin. Sketchfab natively supports 27 3D formats and is integrated with major 3D software platforms, allowing users to publish 3D models from their working tools to the web in 1 click.

We will announce a theme on friday evening, and you will have 24 hours to create a 3D model and compete in this compo.

To submit your entry, upload your model on sketchfab.com by 2013/06/29 at 19:00 CET with the tag demojs.

Winners will get SketchFab licenses and gooodies.

### Special awards

A DemoJS’s panel will give special awards to compos chosen based on the following criteria :

 * **The most browser-compatible demo**&nbsp;: The whole world does not use last version of Chrome, and compatibility between browsers remains a key issue of web development. Also we prefer well-coded generic demos that behave equal in all browsers, than demos which works nice because of browser specific hacks.
 * **The most original demo**&nbsp;: Unusual browser technologies and original concepts will be appreciated.

### Prizes
We have some bounties from our sponsors to offer to the winners:

<!-- * a **3D printed trophy** for the top 3 entries of each compo -->
 * **free tickets** to [Evoke](http://www.evoke.eu/2013/), [Demodays](http://demodays.org/) and [DotJS](http://www.dotjs.eu/)
 * **Goodies**: hoodies, t-shirt, USB keys, ...

But most importantly, you will obtain **PRIDE** of winning a recognized challenge in the JS and demoscene communities!
